Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)
The QFT can be thought of as the quantum equivalent of the classical Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). It transforms a quantum state into a superposition of phases. The general process involves:

Applying Hadamard gates to create superposition.
Controlled phase rotations between the qubits.
Reversing the qubit order for final output.
Algorithm Steps:
Apply the Hadamard gate to each qubit.
Apply controlled phase gates between each qubit pair.
Measure the qubits.
